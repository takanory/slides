## COVID-19 🦠

  * What the difference?

* But...many things are going to change with COVID-19
* Several countries switched to online event
  * However, I wonder what the difference would be if we held online events in different countries

  * Because there is no Taiwanese food, no Taiwanese beer, no Night markets, no Pinapple cake!!
* I'd like to meet the local participants offline
  * And let's go have a beer together
