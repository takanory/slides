   I'm Vice chair of PyCon JP association.

   We launched PyCon JP in 2011.
   At that time, the Python community in Japan was small. So, Masuda-san, Iqbal-san, Ian-san, and I took the lead, and other Python users who were active in Tokyo and other parts of Japan started to form PyCon JP.
   At first, it was a 150-people PyCon JP. Now, we were able to hold a 1,000-people PyCon JP.
   Of course, this year we will have in person event in October.
